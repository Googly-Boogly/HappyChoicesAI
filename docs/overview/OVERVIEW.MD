## Introduction to HappyChoicesAI

#### Purpose and Motivation

HappyChoicesAI was built to address the current lack of AI ethics agents and reliable APIs for debating the ethics of AI situations. It aims to inspire others to create ethical framework AI agents.

Integrating multiple frameworks ensures more reliable ethical considerations and better decisions.
