### Cognitive Architecture Document for HappyChoicesAI

#### Introduction

HappyChoicesAI is designed to assist users in resolving ethical dilemmas by leveraging historical examples and advanced cognitive architecture. This document outlines the cognitive architecture of HappyChoicesAI, detailing each step the AI takes from receiving a dilemma to providing a well-reasoned, ethical solution.

### Process Overview

### User Input
    Step 1: The user provides an ethical dilemma.

### Historical Dilemmas Analysis
    Step 2: The AI searches for parallels between the input dilemma and existing historical dilemmas.
    Step 3: Any relationships or relevant examples are saved to the state for further analysis.

### Key Criteria Determination

    Step 4: The AI identifies key criteria for the input dilemma, which may include:
        Key individuals involved
        Potential actions these individuals could take
        Legal issues that could arise
        Potential consequences of broad actions
        Economic impacts
        Ethical best practices that may be breached or require careful consideration
    Step 5: These criteria are saved to the state.

### Action Determination and Thought Experiments

    Step 6: The AI reviews all previously gathered details and determines potential actions to be taken.
    Step 7: Rigorous thought experiments are performed on each potential action:
        Analyze potential parallels using historical examples and key criteria.
        Assess how the key criteria would change based on the proposed action.
        Determine the percentage change for each criterion (future enhancement with a custom ML model).
        Evaluate the impact on proxies for Happiness and Suffering, first determining how and why these proxies will change, then assessing the actual impact or changes (future enhancement with a custom ML model).
    Step 8: Each thought experiment is summarized, gathering all collected information into one document.

### Decision-Making

    Step 9: The AI makes an argument for and against each thought experiment.
    Step 10: Weighing all information, the AI picks the best action with a reason for its choice (future enhancement with a custom ML model for better and less biased decision-making).

### Transparency and Summary

    Step 11: Summarize all thought experiments that were not chosen.
    Step 12: Create the final summary of the chosen action.
    Step 13: Identify common themes from all thought experiments and the entire process.
    Step 14: Provide a short summary of all historical dilemmas used to make the decision.

### Key Insights and Conclusions

    Step 15: Determine key insights gleaned from the entire process, including significant findings or emerging trends.
    Step 16: Create a final conclusion for the entire process.
    Step 17: Identify key lessons the AI learned for future system improvements.
    Step 18: Option to receive the final document in either JSON or markdown format.
