- For shareholders, while there are upfront costs associated with implementing and maintaining a hybrid system (estimated increase in suffering by 30%), the strategic advantage of attracting and retaining top talent from a broader pool is likely to enhance the company's competitiveness and profitability in the long run. This could increase shareholder happiness by about 30% due to better business outcomes and a stronger public image.

**Conclusion:**

- Implementing a hybrid AI-human recruitment system aligns with utilitarian ethics by maximizing benefits and minimizing harms. The initial investment by shareholders is counterbalanced by long-term gains from improved recruitment processes, leading to better company performance and an enhanced reputation.
- The increase in diversity within the workforce not only enhances individual job satisfaction but also contributes to a more inclusive and innovative corporate culture. This broader benefit to society, coupled with the direct benefits to the company, suggests that the utilitarian choice would be to implement the hybrid system despite the initial costs.

### Thought Experiment 3: AI in Crime Prediction

**Scenario Description:**  
An AI system is used by police departments to predict crime hotspots, but tends to target specific neighborhoods more frequently.

**Choices Available:**

1. Maintain the status quo, allowing the system to operate based on its current algorithms.
2. Adjust the AI to ensure more equitable distribution of policing.
3. Combine AI predictions with community policing initiatives.

**Potential Outcomes:**

1. **Status Quo:** May lead to over-policing in certain areas, risking community trust.
2. **Equitable AI:** Reduces focus on specific neighborhoods but might dilute the effectiveness of crime prevention.
3. **Combined Approach:** Aims to enhance prediction accuracy while building community relationships.

**Utilitarian Analysis:**  
**Ethical Considerations:**

- **Impact of Crime**: Crime adversely affects communities' physical, emotional, and economic well-being. Effective crime prediction tools can significantly reduce these harms.
- **Consequences of Bias**: Biased AI systems can lead to mistrust in law enforcement, compounding the social divide and potentially leading to greater societal unrest.
